"""
Create a Os and Xs program!

The program should do the following:
    - Create three lists for the three rows of the grid (and put three spaces in each one)
	- Repeatedly ask the O user and the X user (one after the other) for a row and column to place a symbol
	- Place the correct symbol for the user at that location
	- For every symbol placed, check if the grid is full, or there are three symbols in a row
	- If full or there is a winner, and the program
