"""
Make a program that asks user for a password.

If it is correct, it allows them to change it to a new one.

For this, create a password in the script. Then ask for the old password (to make sure it's the right person).
Then ask for the new password to change to. However, it should ask for this twice (to make sure they didn't make a mistake).
If the two new passwords are the same, output "Changed".
If not, output an error message.
